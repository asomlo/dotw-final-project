# Drawing on the Web Final Project

Kanye West is almost certainly my favorite music artist. I don't really need to sing his praises, many others have been doing that for more than a decade. For my final project, I'd like to try and create visualizations that match or complement the aesthetic of some of his songs, and the feelings I get when listening to them (possibly to the same rhythm). For a little more thematic consistency, they will all come from the same album: Graduation. I've picked Graduation because I feel that it's electropop rap style creates several tracks that have a really specific/strong sound that could be translated to a unique and fun visual easily. Plus it's particularly apt since I'll be graduating soon.

The tentative track list is as follows:

1. Flashing Lights. An obvious contender - the instrumental is gorgeous. It's probably one of my favorite songs of his period. It reminds me of a neon-lit city at night/dusk in the summer.

2. Stronger. Not one of my favorites. But given the Daft Punk sample, I think it would perfect for some techy wireframe shenanigans with three.js.

3. I Wonder (may change). Lyrics are somewhat melancholy and the delivery is choppy, but the instrumental sounds smooth and triumphant. I'm not sure how, but I'd like to try and represent that juxtaposition.
